Our pipeline will be: summarization of news articles using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.  \n\nBut in this walkthrough, we will be more rigorous about LLMOps.\n\n**Develop an LLM pipeline**\n\nOur LLMOps goals during development are (a) to track what we do carefully for later auditing and reproducibility and (b) to package models or pipelines in a format which will make future deployment easier.  Step-by-step, we will:\n* Load data.\n* Build an LLM pipeline.\n* Test applying the pipeline to data, and log queries and results to MLflow Tracking.\n* Log the pipeline to the MLflow Tracking server as an MLflow Model.\n\n**Test the LLM pipeline**\n\nOur LLMOps goals during testing (in the staging or QA stage) are (a) to track the LLM's progress through testing and towards production and (b) to do so programmatically to demonstrate the APIs needed for future CI/CD automation.  Step-by-step, we will:\n* Register the pipeline to the MLflow Model Registry.\n* Test the pipeline on sample data.\n* Promote the registered model (pipeline) to production.\n\n**Create a production workflow for batch inference**\n\nOur LLMOps goals during production are (a) to write scale-out code which can meet scaling demands in the future and (b) to simplify deployment by using MLflow to write model-agnostic deployment code.  Step-by-step, we will:\n* Load the latest production LLM pipeline from the Model Registry.\n* Apply the pipeline to an Apache Spark DataFrame.\n* Append the results to a Delta Lake table.\n\n### Notes about this workflow\n\n**This notebook vs. modular scripts**: Since this demo is in a single notebook, we will divide the workflow from development to production via notebook sections.  In a more realistic LLM Ops setup, you would likely have the sections split into separate notebooks or scripts.\n\n**Promoting models vs. code**: We track the path from development to production via the MLflow Model Registry.  That is, we are *promoting models* towards production, rather than promoting code.  For more discussion of these two paradigms, see [\"The Big Book of MLOps\"](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/the-big-book-of-mlops).\n\n### Learning Objectives\n1. Walk through a simple but realistic workflow to take an LLM pipeline from development to production.\n2. Make use of MLflow Tracking and the Model Registry to package and manage the pipeline.\n3. Scale out batch inference using Apache Spark and Delta Lake.\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setup\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%capture\n\n!pip install sparkmagic\n!pip install pyspark\n!pip install mlflow\n!pip install pandas --upgrade","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-09T12:02:35.630033Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-09T12:02:35.630455Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-09T12:02:53.555303Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-09T12:02:35.630425Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-09T12:02:53.553990Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"cache_dir = \"./cache\"\nuser_path = \"user\"\nworking_dir= \"./working_dir\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-09T12:15:11.143824Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-09T12:15:11.144704Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-09T12:15:11.148831Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-09T12:15:11.144671Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-09T12:15:11.147884Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":39,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_column', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_seq_items', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 500)\npd.set_option('expand_frame_repr', True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-09T11:40:56.032511Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-09T11:40:56.032891Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-09T11:40:56.413238Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-09T11:40:56.032851Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-09T11:40:56.412426Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <b>2 <span style='color:#78D118'>|</span> Prepare data</b>\n\nFor this notebook we'll use the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum\" target=\"_blank\">Extreme Summarization (XSum) Dataset</a>  with the <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/t5-small\" target=\"_blank\">T5 Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer</a> from Hugging Face.\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-29T10:22:36.998626Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-29T10:22:36.99952Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-29T10:22:37.004082Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-29T10:22:36.999482Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-29T10:22:37.002916Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nxsum_dataset = load_dataset(\n    \"xsum\", \n    version=\"1.2.0\",\n    cache_dir=cache_dir\n)  # Note: We specify cache_dir to use pre-cached data.\nxsum_sample = xsum_dataset[\"train\"].select(range(10))\ndisplay(xsum_sample.to_pandas().head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-09T11:43:15.266215Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-09T11:43:15.266994Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-09T11:43:15.530705Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-09T11:43:15.266964Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-09T11:43:15.529719Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"  0%|          | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3c7c77da00654f1d983f547a09f2f721"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              document  \\\n0  The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.\\nRepair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.\\nTrains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.\\nMany businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.\\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.\\n...   \n1  A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.\\nAs they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\\nOne of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan.

In our case, this is our LLM pipeline.  It contains some number of *runs*.\n\n* **A [run](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#organizing-runs-in-experiments)** generally corresponds to the creation of 1 sub-model, such as 1 trial during hyperparameter tuning in traditional ML.  In our case, executing this notebook once will only create 1 run, but a second execution of the notebook will create a second run.  This version tracking can be useful during iterative development.  Each run contains some number of logged parameters, metrics, tags, models, artifacts, and other metadata.\n* **A [parameter](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#concepts)** is an input to the model or pipeline, such as a regularization parameter in traditional ML or `max_length` for our LLM pipeline.\n* **A [metric](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#concepts)** is an output of evaluation, such as accuracy or loss.\n* **An [artifact](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#concepts)** is an arbitrary file stored alongside a run's metadata, such as the serialized model itself.\n* **A [flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#storage-format)** is an MLflow format for serializing models.  This format uses the underlying ML library's format (such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, or your custom format), plus metadata.\n\n\nMLflow has an API for tracking queries and predictions [`mlflow.llm.log_predictions()`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.llm.html), which we will use below.  Note that, as of MLflow 2.3.1 (Apr 28, 2023), this API is Experimental, so it may change in later releases.  See the [LLM Tracking page](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llm-tracking.html) for more information.\n\n***Tip***: We wrap our model development workflow with a call to `with mlflow.start_run():`.  This context manager syntax starts and ends the MLflow run explicitly, which is a best practice for code which may be moved to production.
